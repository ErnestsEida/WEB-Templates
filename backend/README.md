# Backend

### API
**API** is a type of backend system that works with incoming data and responds to these requests with known formats(XML, JSON, ...).
Requests are sent out by a frontend or any other system that pass data or do the request to a certain path, so they know what to expect in return.

### MVC (model-view-controller)
**MVC** is a type of backend that handles both requests and also do the displaying part. In simple terms:

> **Model:** is the information storer and preset manipulator (a class or something, but it doesnt interact directly with incoming data)   

> **Views:** these are the parts where you display and style your page and the data that comes with it.

> **Controllers:** are the messengers that recieve the incoming request for data processing/gathering/creation... adjusts it and using views returns to the user
